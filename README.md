# Best Restaurants (Yelp Clone)

This is a Yelp clone built in one day at Epicodus.  It was an atempt at a yelp clone with functionality to add restaurants and search by name, type, location or price.  Currently, no database is synced and all data is stored in the DOM. It was created for practice in using AngularJS directives and Bootswatch themes.  You can view a version of the site hosted on github [here](http://alexkaufman06.github.io/best-restaurants/).

### Bug Reports:
Currently, no database is synced and all data is stored in the DOM.  Thus, refreshing the page will delete any new restaurants added to the page.
